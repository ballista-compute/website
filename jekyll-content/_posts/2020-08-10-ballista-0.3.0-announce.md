The goal of the 0.3.0 release is to provide a minimum viable product of distributed compute in Rust. It is now possible
to run a query that is very close to TPC-H query 1 on a distributed cluster with reasonable performance. Performance 
and scalability is comparable to Apache Spark (within the range of 2x slower to 2x faster based on initial benchmarks). 

Performance tuning will be one of the main areas of focus for the 0.4.0 release.

Please refer to the [user guide](/docs) for installation instructions. Release notes are available [here](/release/2020/08/09/ballista-0.3.0/).
