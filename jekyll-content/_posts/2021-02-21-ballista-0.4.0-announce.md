With this release, Ballista was re-implemented from scratch to take advantage of the many changes in Apache Arrow
3.0.0, especially some major refactoring in the DataFusion query engine that made it easier for projects such as
Ballista to extend DataFusion's functionality.

It is now possible to run TPC-H queries 1, 3, 5, 6, 10, and 12 against a distributed cluster.

Please refer to the [user guide](/docs) for installation instructions. Release notes are available 
[here](/release/2021/02/20/ballista-0.4.0/).
