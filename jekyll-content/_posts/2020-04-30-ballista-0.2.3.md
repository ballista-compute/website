This release contains the following improvements to the JVM query engine:

- The CSV data source is now much faster due to some simple optimizations being implemented. As a result of these improvements, the JVM executor now has similar performance to the Rust and Spark executors for an aggregate query against one month's worth of NYC Taxi data.
- The `CAST` expression is now supported for casting between numeric and string data types.

This release also contains the following improvements:

- The Rust integration test now runs the same aggregate query against all three executors (JVM, Rust, Spark) and they all produce identical results.
- A packaging issue was resolved that was preventing Java artifacts from being published to Maven Central.

Release artifacts are now available on [Maven Central](https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:%20org.ballistacompute), [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/ballistacompute), and [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/ballista).
